entry box with place holder: Team 1

dropdown with label, but the three options (With unset as option) are always set to the results of the team entry boxes: Home Team

with those things, also add a button called submit, and it will call start.handelGraphics(timer, timerValue, possession, switch, team1, team2, homeTeam)
timer is a boolean, timerValue is a interger with colon, possession is a boolean, switch is a boolean, team1 is a string, team2 is a string, homeTeam is a string (Must be set to a value of a team1, team2)
